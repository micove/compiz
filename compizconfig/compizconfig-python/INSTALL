Basic Installation
==================

   CompizConfig Python Bindings use the distutils buildsystem to translate,
build and install the bindings.

   See the Distutils documentation for more information on how to use the
specifics of the buildsystem. At the moment, you probably just want to issue
something like:

   # python setup.py install

Command Line Arguments
======================

   If you want to install to a particular prefix (eg /opt) then you would use
   the '--prefix' switch:

   # python setup.py install --prefix=/opt

Environment Variables
=====================

   CompizConfig Python Bindings might require some environment variables
   if you installed LibCompizConfig to a non-standard location. Currently,
   only PKG_CONFIG_PATH is supported, and this is used to find the
   pkgconfig file to determine the libcompizconfig install location for
   linking

   # PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/lib/pkgconfig python setup.py install
