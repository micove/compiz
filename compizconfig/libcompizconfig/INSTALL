libcompizconfig uses out-of-tree builds with cmake, in order to generate the Makefiles for compiz use:

	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ cmake ..

After that, standard build procedures apply:

	$ make
	# make install

In order to build other backends, you will need to install the compizconfig cmake set

	# make findcompizconfig_install
