COMPIZ AUTOPILOT ACCEPTANCE TESTS
=================================

compiz_autopilot_acceptance_tests is a simple Google Test wrapper around
a suite of Unity Autopilot tests which effectively validate window manager
functionality by actually interacting with a running instance.

Note: These tests are very sensitive. There's a high chance of false-positives
unless your session is set up exactly as indicated below:

  1. Use a session with a completely default configuration. This might
     include an Ubuntu guest session, or a new user.
  2. Do not have any external monitors plugged in, even in mirror mode.
     Gdk will detect any plugged in monitors and report them as
     part of the monitors available - autopilot assumes that the monitors
     are always in xinerama mode, which may cause tests to fail in very
     non-obvious ways.
  3. Do not have any other windows open at the time the test binary is
     launched. It is suggested to launch the test binary from another
     session with the same environment variables present in the
     guest session.

Do not add this binary to the auto-test discovery.
