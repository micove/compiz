* Plugin interface

* Plugin with SVG-based theme support

* Plugin that supports old metacity themes

----- Cleanup TODO:
 * Allow frame keying types for frame types, so
   /2d/window_type/state/id , this way we can have
   different shadows per-frame and much more granular
   memory control (decor_t just becomes a handle to some
   decoration specific stuff, decor_frame_t becomes a
   table of shared resources held by all decor_t's
 * Completely seal off the values of structs and use
   only getter and setter functions to control API
 * Start implementing a system in GObject
 * Put all the globals into their own structs or namespaces
