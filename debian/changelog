compiz (0.6.3~git20071222.061ff159-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream (git snapshot) release.  Refreshed quilt patches.
  * Remove build-dependency on libfuse-dev, since we explicitly disable the
    fuse plugin and it causes FTBFS on non-linux arches.  It should also make
    backporting easier (closes: #451149, #455516).
  * compiz-manager-posixly-correct.patch: fix from Brian Carlson to get
    compiz-manager to run when POSIXLY_CORRECT is set (always pass
    options before arguments closes: #456628).
  * Remove libmetacity entry from shlibs override (closes: #455515) Thanks to
    Rober Millan for noticing this.
  * Remove outdated info in README.Debian for compiz-core (closes: #454340).
  * lintian:
    - Standards-Version to 3.7.3
    - libdecoration0-dev to section libdevel

compiz (0.6.3~git20071208.25941d14-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [Sean Finney]
  * New upstream (git snapshot) release.
  * Remove autofoo generated content and create/remove it as part of the
    standard build process instead.
  * Similarly, add Build-Deps on autoconf and similar stuff.
  * Remove the old/buggy compiz.wrapper script and now use Kristian Lyngstol's
    compiz-manager script as a drop-in replacement for it.  This should fix
    numerous problems with plugin settings and window decorators not behaving
    properly.  specifically, it closes: #449389, #390929, #400583, #440095.
    it also closes: #446901, #447345 closes: #393501, #445026.  
  * Update copyright file accordingly.

  * oops, shipping copies of a few .h and .pc files in both compiz-dev
    and libdecoration0-dev.  fixed.

compiz (0.5.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * updated/massaged various quilt patches
  * make sure configure is executable at build time.  seems that this
    causes problems in a pbuilder environment

compiz (0.5.0.dfsg-3) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Restore all ${misc:Depends} in debian/control so that for instance
    compiz-gtk and compiz-plugins gets the required dependency on gconf2
    (for gconf-schemas in postinst), closes: #436432.

 -- Brice Goglin <bgoglin@debian.org>  Tue, 07 Aug 2007 15:10:49 +0200

compiz (0.5.0.dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Drop the now obsolete Source-Version in favour of binary:Version in
    debian/control.
  * Replace --strict-binding and --use-cow documentation by --loose-binding
    and --use-root-window respectively in the compiz.real manpage. Thanks
    Michael Gilbert. (Closes: 432920)
  * Rearrange and add missing command-line options in the compiz.real manpage.
  * compiz-gtk needs to conflict with libmetacity0 (<< 1:2.15.21) because of
    an incompatible ABI change. This should really be fixed in libmetacity. A
    shlibs bump should do the trick. (Closes: 425631)
  * Add upstream patch that fixes non-tfp textures (icons, cube top image
    etc.) on big endian platforms. Thanks Michel DÃ¤nzer.
  * Run dh_makeshlibs with -V. (Closes: 425463)
  * Use package-local shlibs override file to depend on libmetacity0 (>=
    1:2.15.21) and libdecoration0 (>= 0.5.0). Thanks Sune Vuorela.

    - Remove stencil buffer requirement.
    - Focus stealing prevention support.
    - Better occlusion detection and more efficient rendering.
    - Added plugins:
      + blur: blur windows and contents behind translucent windows
      + fuse: map compiz options to a file-system
      + ini: flat file configuration backend
      + inotify: file change notification
      + video: composited video interface for efficient playback
  * Forward-port patches:
    - Dropped 012_debian-kde-includes-dir.patch, no longer needed.
    - Dropped 013_set-qtdir-fallback.patch, no longer needed.
    - Refresh other patches.
  * Use compiz' default set of plugins.

  * No longer conflict with metacity >= 2.15.21, now that metacity 2.18 is in
    unstable. (Closes: #411012)
  * Add symlink to the compiz-core README to the compiz package.
    (Closes: #408605)

compiz (0.3.6-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Thierry Reding ]
  * New upstream release:
    + Drop 002_tfp-server-extension.patch, obsolete.
    + Drop 005_glfinish.patch, fixed upstream.
    + Refresh 011_snap-by-default.patch.
  * Replace build-dependency on libdbus-1-dev by libdbus-glib-1-dev.
  * Add build-dependency on kdebase-dev and libdbus-qt-1-dev for the KDE
    window decorator.
  * Add patch 012_debian-kde-includes-dir to correctly detect the KDE include
    directory on Debian systems.
  * Add patch 013_set-qtdir-fallback to set the QTDIR variable to /usr if it
    has not explicitly been set before. This allows the configure script to
    correctly detect the moc compiler.
  * Add the compiz-kde package which provides a window decorator for KDE.
    Closes: #390338.
  * Add the libdecoration0 and libdecoration0-dev packages. libdecoration0 is
    needed by both Gtk and KDE window decorators while libdecoration0-dev can
    be used to write additional decorators.
  * Add patch 015_optional-fbo which adds a command-line option for disabling
    the use of FBOs (work around buggy drivers). Add the --no-fbo option to
    command-line in the compiz wrapper.
  * Remove the --strict-binding and --use-cow options from the command-line in
    the compiz wrapper. These are now the defaults.
  * Add png and svg to the list of default plugins. They are needed to load
    PNG and SVG images (e.g. for the cube's top face).
  * Check whether the GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap extension is available in
    direct or indirect rendering contexts. If it is available only in indirect
    rendering contexts, force compiz to use indirect rendering.

compiz (0.3.4-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    + Drop 012_metacity-theme-support.patch, fixed upstream.
    + Drop 013_fix-default-plugins.patch, fixed upstream.
    + Refresh all other patches.
  * Don't use xsfbs anymore until there's an easy way to keep it up-to-date
    in git repositories. For now using quilt works just fine.
  * Drop build-dependencies on automake1.9 and libtool because we don't run
    the complete autotools stack anymore.
  * Add missing dependencies to the compiz-dev package. It needs to pull in
    all packages required by its pkgconfig file.
  * Add a dependency on libgl1-mesa-dev | libgl-dev to compiz-dev because
    compiz.h includes files provided in that package.

compiz (0.3.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Closes: #396770.
    + Remove 010_snap-inverted.patch, applied upstream.
    + Refreshed other patches to apply cleanly again.
    + Remove gtk-window-decorator.schemas and use the one provided by
      upstream (gtk/window-decorator/gwd.schemas).
  * Targetted at experimental until the release of etch.

compiz (0.2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Thierry Reding ]
  * New upstream release:
    + Drop 013_dont-fail-if-theme-not-found.patch, applied upstream.
  * Make 012_metacity-theme-support also patch the configure script, not only
    configure.ac.
  * Add 013_fix-default-plugins.patch which fixes upstream's handling of the
    default plugins configuration variable.
  * Make all plugins that were enabled in previous versions default plugins so
    compiz' behaviour doesn't change. Drop the 'water' plugin because our X
    server does not support it yet.
  * Drop --disable-kde from the configure flags because it is now disabled by
    default.
  * Add a dependency on mesa-utils to compiz-core to provide glxinfo that is
    needed by the compiz wrapper. Thanks Per Bojsen.
    Closes: #393113.
  * Conflict with libmetacity0 (>= 1:2.15.21) because it would currently make
    gtk-window-decorator segfault.

  [ David Nusinow ]
  * Add myself to uploaders. Thierry is still the primary maintainer.

    metacity library for theme support so that compiz can be built for Debian
    unstable.
  * Install a schemas file for the Gtk window decorator which is used to
    enable the use of metacity themes.
  * Suggest nvidia-glx (>= 1.0.9625-1). (Closes: #390326).
  * Add code to the compiz wrapper to handle the NVIDIA GLX implementation
    Closes: #390814.
  * No longer build static versions of the plugins.
  * Remove .la files manually because they are not needed.
  * Clean up build-dependencies:
    + Remove unnecessarily versioned build-dependencies.
    + Tighten the build-dependency on libxcomposite-dev to (>= 1:0.3-2).
      Closes: 390304, 390416.
  * Add a manpage documenting the compiz wrapper.
  * Check if the gconf plugin is installed before trying to load it in the
    wrapper.
  * Enable building the gconf-dump plugin.
  * Add a README file to the compiz-core package.
  * List copyright holders and contributors in the copyright file.
    Closes: #392422.
  * Add 013_dont-fail-if-theme-not-found.patch which will make compiz use its
    default theme if the metacity theme cannot be found.
  * Make compiz-gtk suggest gnome-themes so people can take advantage of the
    metacity theme support.

  [ David Nusinow ]
  * Tighten up all the X library build-depends by explicitly using current
    versions. Thanks aj.

compiz (0.0.13+git20060928-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change the maintainer field to the Debian X Strike Force.
  * Add myself to the uploaders field.
  * Move compiz.{docs,install,manpages} to compiz-core.{docs,install,manpages}
    so the installed files end up in the correct package.
  * Rename compiz.1 to compiz.real.1, because it's actually documenting the
    real compiz binary.

 -- Thierry Reding <thierry@gilfi.de>  Fri, 29 Sep 2006 09:24:30 +0200

compiz (0.0.13+git20060928-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release. (Closes: #352151)
  * Install the compiz schema during postinst and removes it during prerm
    (using dh_gconf).

    sure compiz gets built with the correct opcodes for the GLX_EXT_tfp
    extension.
  * Add build-dependency on libmetacity-dev, which is needed for metacity
    theme support.
  * Add the compiz-gtk package containing the former gnome-window-decorator.
    The compiz-gnome package provides the files necessary to integrate compiz
    and compiz-gtk with the GNOME desktop environment.
  * Add a build-dependency on libxinerama-dev, needed to build compiz with
    support for the xinerama extension.
  * Revise the compiz.1 manpage.
