        handling rendering calls. Suggested by Michel DÃ¤nzer to ensure
        we don't have any rendering glitches.
    * 017_always_unredirect_screensaver_on_nvidia.patch:
      - always unredirect gnome-screensaver when using nvidia, workaround

    directory on Debian systems.
  * Add patch 013_set-qtdir-fallback to set the QTDIR variable to /usr if it
    has not explicitly been set before. This allows the configure script to
    correctly detect the moc compiler.
  * Add the compiz-kde package which provides a window decorator for KDE.
    Closes: #390338.
  * Add the libdecoration0 and libdecoration0-dev packages. libdecoration0 is
    needed by both Gtk and KDE window decorators while libdecoration0-dev can
    be used to write additional decorators.
  * Add patch 015_optional-fbo which adds a command-line option for disabling
    the use of FBOs (work around buggy drivers). Add the --no-fbo option to

  * Remove the --strict-binding and --use-cow options from the command-line in

  * Add png and svg to the list of default plugins. They are needed to load
    PNG and SVG images (e.g. for the cube's top face).
  * Check whether the GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap extension is available in
    direct or indirect rendering contexts. If it is available only in indirect
    rendering contexts, force compiz to use indirect rendering.

  * Drop build-dependencies on automake1.9 and libtool because we don't run
    the complete autotools stack anymore.
  * Add missing dependencies to the compiz-dev package. It needs to pull in
    all packages required by its pkgconfig file.
  * Add a dependency on libgl1-mesa-dev | libgl-dev to compiz-dev because
    compiz.h includes files provided in that package.

compiz (0.2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Thierry Reding ]
  * New upstream release:
    + Drop 013_dont-fail-if-theme-not-found.patch, applied upstream.
  * Make 012_metacity-theme-support also patch the configure script, not only
    configure.ac.
  * Add 013_fix-default-plugins.patch which fixes upstream's handling of the
    default plugins configuration variable.
  * Make all plugins that were enabled in previous versions default plugins so
    compiz' behaviour doesn't change. Drop the 'water' plugin because our X
    server does not support it yet.
  * Drop --disable-kde from the configure flags because it is now disabled by
    default.
  * Add a dependency on mesa-utils to compiz-core to provide glxinfo that is
    needed by the compiz wrapper. Thanks Per Bojsen.
    Closes: #393113.
  * Conflict with libmetacity0 (>= 1:2.15.21) because it would currently make
    gtk-window-decorator segfault.

  [ David Nusinow ]
  * Add myself to uploaders. Thierry is still the primary maintainer.

compiz (0.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Thierry Reding ]
  * New upstream release.
    + Drop 011_plane-plugin-schema.patch, applied upstream.
    + Drop 012_freedesktop-schema.patch, applied upstream.
  * Replace 010_snap-by-default by the upstream patch 010_snap-inverted and
    add 011_snap-by-default to enable snapping by default.
  * Add 012_metacity-theme-support.patch which uses an older version of the
    metacity library for theme support so that compiz can be built for Debian
    unstable.
  * Install a schemas file for the Gtk window decorator which is used to
    enable the use of metacity themes.
  * Suggest nvidia-glx (>= 1.0.9625-1). (Closes: #390326).
  * Add code to the compiz wrapper to handle the NVIDIA GLX implementation
    Closes: #390814.
  * No longer build static versions of the plugins.
  * Remove .la files manually because they are not needed.
  * Clean up build-dependencies:
    + Remove unnecessarily versioned build-dependencies.
    + Tighten the build-dependency on libxcomposite-dev to (>= 1:0.3-2).
      Closes: 390304, 390416.
  * Add a manpage documenting the compiz wrapper.
  * Check if the gconf plugin is installed before trying to load it in the
    wrapper.
  * Enable building the gconf-dump plugin.
  * Add a README file to the compiz-core package.
  * List copyright holders and contributors in the copyright file.
    Closes: #392422.
  * Add 013_dont-fail-if-theme-not-found.patch which will make compiz use its
    default theme if the metacity theme cannot be found.
  * Make compiz-gtk suggest gnome-themes so people can take advantage of the
    metacity theme support.

  [ David Nusinow ]
  * Tighten up all the X library build-depends by explicitly using current
    versions. Thanks aj.

compiz (0.0.13+git20060928-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change the maintainer field to the Debian X Strike Force.
  * Add myself to the uploaders field.
  * Move compiz.{docs,install,manpages} to compiz-core.{docs,install,manpages}
    so the installed files end up in the correct package.
  * Rename compiz.1 to compiz.real.1, because it's actually documenting the
    real compiz binary.

compiz (0.0.13+git20060928-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release. (Closes: #352151)
  * Install the compiz schema during postinst and removes it during prerm
    (using dh_gconf).
  * Add patches by Kristian HÃ¸gsberg to make compiz work on AIGLX:
    + 002_tfp-server-extension.patch
    + 005_glfinish.patch
  * No longer build the compiz-kde package, because it is unusable.
  * Add gtk-window-decorator.1 manpage.
  * Install the window settings configuration plugin into the right location
    (/usr/lib/libgnome-window-settings1/libcompiz.so).
  * Bump build-dependency on libxcomposite-dev (>= 0.3) because it provides
    the XComposite{Get,Release}OverlayWindow functions.
  * Install a compiz wrapper as /usr/bin/compiz to call compiz.real with
    required arguments (load gconf plugin).
  * Add 010_snap-by-default.patch to turn snapping on by default.
  * Add a versioned build-dependency on x11proto-gl-dev (>= 1.4.8-1) to make
    sure compiz gets built with the correct opcodes for the GLX_EXT_tfp
    extension.
  * Add build-dependency on libmetacity-dev, which is needed for metacity
    theme support.
  * Add the compiz-gtk package containing the former gnome-window-decorator.
    The compiz-gnome package provides the files necessary to integrate compiz
    and compiz-gtk with the GNOME desktop environment.
  * Add a build-dependency on libxinerama-dev, needed to build compiz with
    support for the xinerama extension.
  * Revise the compiz.1 manpage.
  * Rename the compiz package to compiz-core and make compiz a meta-package
    pulling in everything necessary to run compiz from within GNOME.
  * Add 011_plane-plugin-schema.patch by Eugene Konev adding gconf settings
    for the plane plugin.
  * Add 012_freedesktop-schema.patch that fixes a typo in compiz.schema.in.
