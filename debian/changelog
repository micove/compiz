compiz (0.0.13+git20060928-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change the maintainer field to the Debian X Strike Force.
  * Add myself to the uploaders field.
  * Move compiz.{docs,install,manpages} to compiz-core.{docs,install,manpages}
    so the installed files end up in the correct package.
  * Rename compiz.1 to compiz.real.1, because it's actually documenting the
    real compiz binary.

compiz (0.0.13+git20060928-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release. (Closes: #352151)
  * Install the compiz schema during postinst and removes it during prerm
    (using dh_gconf).
  * Add patches by Kristian HÃ¸gsberg to make compiz work on AIGLX:
    + 002_tfp-server-extension.patch
    + 005_glfinish.patch
  * No longer build the compiz-kde package, because it is unusable.
  * Add gtk-window-decorator.1 manpage.
  * Install the window settings configuration plugin into the right location
    (/usr/lib/libgnome-window-settings1/libcompiz.so).
  * Bump build-dependency on libxcomposite-dev (>= 0.3) because it provides
    the XComposite{Get,Release}OverlayWindow functions.
  * Install a compiz wrapper as /usr/bin/compiz to call compiz.real with
    required arguments (load gconf plugin).
  * Add 010_snap-by-default.patch to turn snapping on by default.
  * Add a versioned build-dependency on x11proto-gl-dev (>= 1.4.8-1) to make
    sure compiz gets built with the correct opcodes for the GLX_EXT_tfp
    extension.
  * Add build-dependency on libmetacity-dev, which is needed for metacity
    theme support.
  * Add the compiz-gtk package containing the former gnome-window-decorator.
    The compiz-gnome package provides the files necessary to integrate compiz
    and compiz-gtk with the GNOME desktop environment.
  * Add a build-dependency on libxinerama-dev, needed to build compiz with
    support for the xinerama extension.
  * Revise the compiz.1 manpage.
  * Rename the compiz package to compiz-core and make compiz a meta-package
    pulling in everything necessary to run compiz from within GNOME.
  * Add 011_plane-plugin-schema.patch by Eugene Konev adding gconf settings
    for the plane plugin.
  * Add 012_freedesktop-schema.patch that fixes a typo in compiz.schema.in.
