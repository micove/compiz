Release 0.9.8.4 (2012-09-27 Daniel van Vugt <daniel.van.vugt@canonical.com>)
============================================================================

Highlights

  * Fixed a few crashes affecting a lot of people. Especially users of VMs and
    LLVMpipe.
  * Significant improvements to "Unredirect Fullscreen Windows" mode, which
    is particularly useful for fullscreen gaming performance.
    - Flickering is mostly fixed.
    - Multi-monitor unredirect is dramatically faster than previous versions.
    - Fixed automatic redirect/unredirect entry/exit bugs.
    To try it out, enable: CCSM > Composite > Unredirect Fullscreen Windows.
    The option is not enabled by default yet because there are some issues
    with driver stability, particularly with nouveau and intel.
  * Major gsettings/compizconfig bug fixes and refactoring with lots more
    test cases.

Release 0.9.8.2 (2012-09-10 Daniel van Vugt <daniel.van.vugt@canonical.com>)
============================================================================

Highlights

  * gtk-window-decorator has been fully ported from GConf to GSettings.
  * Gamers rejoice! CCSM > Composite > "Unredirect Fullscreen Windows" now
    works more reliably, with a few bugs remaining. If you turn it on then
    fullscreen windows like games will get direct rendering access and won't
    be slowed by Compiz (or Unity) any more.

Release 0.9.8.0 (2012-08-23 Daniel van Vugt <daniel.van.vugt@canonical.com>)
============================================================================

Major New Features
  
  * Single source tree: All plugins/libraries are in lp:compiz now
  * OpenGL|ES support (e.g. for ARM platforms)
  * GSettings support, as a backend for storing compizconfig
  * Buffer swapping on every frame: allowing compiz to take advantage of
    driver features such as page flipping and triple/quad buffering. This
    results in noticeably higher physical frame rates, and smoother graphics.

Disabled Features

  In order to complete support for OpenGL|ES, some plugins were not (yet)
  ported and have been disabled for now. Those are: animationaddon, bicubic,
  blur, colorfilter, cubeaddon, gears, group, loginout, reflex, thumbnail,
  stackswitch, wallpaper, trip. However, those are only 13 out of 84 plugins.
  We welcome patches to revive the disabled plugins.
